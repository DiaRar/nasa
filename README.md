# Radiation Shielding
## Neutron and Gamma rays shielding
Neutron shielding will be made with a 20cm layer of:  LiBH<sub>4</sub>  (lithium borohydride).<br>
During research it is shown that only 0.038% of the neutrons make it through a 20 cm shield of natural LiBH4
***
It can be further enhanced by replacing lythium borohydride with its enhanced version: <sup>6</sup>Li<sup>10</sup>BH<sub>4</sub> - for which only 0.027% pass through( for 20cm of borohydride ).
